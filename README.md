# EnergyEconomicsE2023 (*Currently under revision*)
Code repository for core models and exercises for the course "Energy Economics of the Green Transition" at UCPH, 2023 version.

## Installation guide:
The models require installation of Python (e.g. through *Anaconda*), some type of git tool (e.g. *Github Desktop*, Git, Tortoise), and an editor for python code (e.g. *VSCode* or Sublime). The course *Introduction to Programming and Numerical Analysis* provides some pretty detailed guides for setting up Python and VSCode: https://numeconcopenhagen.netlify.app/guides/. We do, however, rely on different packages in this course, so you will need to supplement the installation with a few extra steps.

#### Requirements (after installation):
* Open "Anaconda Prompt" ("Terminal" for Mac) and write: ```conda install jupyterlab nodejs pandas openpyxl scipy```.
* Also from "Anaconda Prompt" ("Terminal" for Mac): ```pip install seaborn pyDbs```.

If you already have some of these packages installed, you might need to update them. In particular, you'll need:
 * pandas version >=1.3.1 
 * scipy version >=1.8.0
